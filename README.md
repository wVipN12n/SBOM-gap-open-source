This is a anonymous open source repository for paper "Bridging the Gap: A Large-Scale Analysis of SBOM Toolsâ€™ Alignment with Standards"

## Introduction
Software bill of materials (SBOM) tools are key to enhancing transparency and security in software supply chains by documenting critical information about software. Although standards like SPDX and CycloneDX provide well-defined formats and guidelines for creating SBOMs, limited research exists on whether SBOM tools fully adhere to these standards in practice. In this paper, we evaluate the compliance of SBOM tools with these standards across C/C++, Java, and Python repositories by analyzing their generated SBOMs.

Our study involves the evaluation of 26,194 SBOMs generated by SBOM tools from 3,287 real-world software repositories. The results show that while SBOM tools achieve 100\% compliance with mandatory requirements specified by SBOM standards, they struggle to meet additional  government-mandated regulations. Furthermore, consistency analyses reveal significant discrepancies in information organization and representation across SBOM tools, indicating gaps in the interpretation and application of SBOM standards. These inconsistencies affect the ability of SBOMs to be used interchangeably and highlight the challenge of standard adherence.

We also identify root causes contributing to these gaps and offer a discussion on potential solutions to guide the evolution of the SBOM ecosystem. Our findings aim to support the improvement of SBOM tool precision and facilitate better management practices within software engineering.

## Usage

All the results in paper are in the `results` folder.

The ground truth dataset is in `benchmark-python.zip`, also, the unzipped files are at benchmark-python folder. As the size of all the SBOM file dataset is large(`49.2GB`), anonymously uploading them is impractical, we provide a small dataset in the test-sboms folder for you to test the code.

The code of paper is in the code folder. It is divided into three parts as introduced in the paper: `extract.py`, `match.py` and `evaluate.py`.

For  **fast check**, download the `fast-check.zip`, and unzip it into `fast-check` folder, then following the instruction. The download link is at [here](https://ufile.io/o4wdv4x5), cheksums: SHA-1 DF1FCC54E48DB06464A13422E63C7CA20492F7A6.

The code is written in Python, and the required packages are in `code/requirements.txt`. You can install the required packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We provide a all-in-one script to run the code for assessing the consistency of SBOM tools in the transfrom application, you can run the following command to run the code:
```bash
python test-run.py
```

It contains the following steps:
1. Extracts required data fields of the SBOMs and reformat them into JSON files. 
2. Match the peer-to-peer information in different data fields of SBOMs.
3. Evaluate the paired information in the matched SBOMs with the evalutaion operation provided by the evaluta module.
4. Give some basic statistics and output the results in a format of CSV file.

The results of the `test-run.py` will be in the `results` folder.
