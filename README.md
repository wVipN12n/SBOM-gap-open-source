This is a anonymous open source repository for paper "A Large Scale Empirical Analysis on the Adherence Gap between Standards and Tools in SBOM"

## Introduction

Software bill of materials (SBOM) is a structured document that stores software information into multiple data fields. It can be utilized to enhance transparency and security in software supply chains by recording dependencies and their information. To help exchange and utilize the SBOM, normative organizations propose SBOM standards that comprehensively define structures and data fields for the SBOM. Following these standards, applied organizations implement tools for generating and utilizing the SBOM. However, limited studies exist on investigating whether these applied SBOM tools fully adhere to normative standards.

This paper analyzes the adherence gap between standards and tools in SBOM. To make the analysis, we design and implement SAP, a framework for evaluating SBOM tools against SBOM standards in real-world. Utilizing SAP, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on 3,287 real-world repositories. The results show that SBOM tools achieve 100\% adherence with mandatory data fields defined by SBOM standards, enabling basic interoperability. But three major gaps are found in compliance, consistency and accuracy of SBOM tools against standards.
We explore root causes contributing to these gaps and offer a discussion on potential solutions to help improve both SBOM standards and tools.

## Usage

All the results in paper are in the `results` folder. The resources for download is upload to zenodo with ID 10.5281/zenodo.14998625, including the 26,194 SBOMs generated by the six tools, fast check code and related SBOMs.

### Docker image for generating SBOMs yourself
We upload the replication docker image that contains all the installed environments of the SBOM tools anonymously at [[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/d32s3a/anonymous-opensource)], you can get it by the following command:

```bash
docker pull d32s3a/anonymous-opensource:1.0
```

Use `conda env list` to see all the environments of SBOM tools. The `ort` is at `/all-sbom-tools/ort-35.0.0/ort/cli/build/install/ort/bin/ort`(name with 35.0.0 but it is 36.0.0 as described in paper). The other tools can run directly with its name in their corresponding conda envs. 
All the scripts in SAP for SBOM generation locate at `run-sbom-tools` folder. These scripts need to run in the docker except `cdxgen` that need to interact with docker thus runs on host.

## Run the code

### For fast check on test SBOMs

We provide a small dataset in the test-sboms folder for you to test the code. Download the `run-on-test-sboms.zip` at 10.5281/zenodo.14998625, and unzip it, then follow the instruction.

We provide a all-in-one script to run the code for evaluating the adherence gap of SBOM tools and SBOM standards. You can run the following command to run the code on the test-sboms dataset:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test-run.py
```

As the test sboms are just 42 randomly selected repositories from Python part of the $D_{repo}$, the results are different from our paper but still can check our code. If you want to run the code on all the SBOMs, see next part.

### Run on all SBOMs
If you want to rerun the whole process of SAP on all SBOMs, download and unzip the all-sboms.zip(around 50GB after unzip) at 10.5281/zenodo.14998625, and change the `dir` in test-run.py and rerun again(possible clean up of the result dir is needed).

The results of the `test-run.py` will be in the `test-sbom-results` folder.
